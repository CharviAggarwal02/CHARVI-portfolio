   - In `index.html`, find the following line in the Hero section:
     ```html
     <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1544005313-94ddf0286df2?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=688&q=80" alt="Charvi Aggarwal" class="w-full h-full object-cover">
